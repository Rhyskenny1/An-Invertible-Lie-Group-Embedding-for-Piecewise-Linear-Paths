# An-Invertible-Lie-Group-Embedding-for-Piecewise-Linear-Paths
The Cartan development of a path onto a Lie group has emerged as a useful tool in
rough path theory, containing considerable information about the underlying path. We
examine its potential for use in synthesising time-series data, specifically a method for
reclaiming a d-dimensional path from its development onto the Lie group $SO(d, 1)$. We
provide numerical implementation of existing theory and propose a refinement of existing
methods to aid practical viability for certain important classes of paths.
